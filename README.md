### Mixed Reality Computer Vision

With the recent explosion of self-driving cars, computer vision, thereafter CV, has become one of the leading real-world implementations of AI and continues to improve exponentially. This has had a big effect on the recent quality of AR and MR inside-out tracking products, like the Quest 2.  Furthermore, with the introduction of the transformer into CV, a technology previously used only for text-based AI like GPT-3, the possibility of various algorithms like procedurally generating VR environments based on real-world geometry move closer. We propose an open-source mixed-reality library built onto the existing OpenCV library, open to software and hardware developers world-wide to experiment, implement and solve real-world applications of MR and VR. We hope to bridge the technological gap of advanced mathematical concepts used in projecting and triangulating real-world environments and the implementation of software-specific needs.

TODO:
make it not suck
make decent readme
make the thing in C or Cpp
