### Mixed Reality Computer Vision

MRCV is an open-source computer vision library that abstracts the [SLAM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simultaneous_localization_and_mapping)  / geometrical environment and position tracking for developers. Currently it doesn't do anything worthwhile, but the goal is to ease the process of building hardware HMDs DIY projects or various environment based algorithms. It makes use of the existing [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/) library.
